One Corner
===========

One corner on the web, it is Mingli's IPFS file repository, and will collect some thinking and experiments on human knowledge and its distributed nature. IPFS looks cool, maybe we can evolve the web in a creative way by this technology.

This repo is a wiki powered by realms-wiki at the begining, I will try to adapt the software to IPFS.

Let's reshape the world by making something real.
